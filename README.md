# PSIML-Homework
These are the assignments from the qualifying round for PSIML summer school for machine learning.\
I had five days to complete these three assignments to the best of my ability, using Python.

# Assingnments

For this assignments, i had three tasks:\
**I task** was to count all the files and directories in the given file system input. \

### **3 Olympic rings detection**

For this assignments, i had two tasks:\
**I task** was to count all the pixels for Y B K G R colrs in the given picture.\
**II task** was to detect valid olympic logos on the picture.\
For this task i had to use Hough transform algorithm for circle detection to find the coordinates of their centers and detect if they collide with their neighboring circle of correct color to determine if the logo is valid.\
